# 1. Migrating an on premises database to Azure

## Overview

We have an on-premise web app, with a SQL database which we would like to move into the Cloud.

First we need to get the database set up in Azure. The steps will be:

* Take a backup of the existing database
* Upload the backup to Azure
* Create a new SQL Server and Database in Azure
* Restore the backup to it

We want to also give each developer their own database to test against later, so we will automate the last two steps using an ARM template.

## Setup

Make sure you have Azure CLI and Azure Data Studio with the [dacpac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/sql-server-dacpac-extension?view=sql-server-ver15) extension.

You might also like to use the [ARM Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools) extension - it provides autocompletion and other useful features when working with ARM templates.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create database backup

The first thing we need to do is create a backup of the "on-premises" database, so we can restore it to our new cloud environment. For the purposes of this exercise, the "on-premises" database will actually be another Azure DB, whose details will be provided to you.

We will connect to this database using Azure Data Studio and backup the database to a `BACPAC` file.

> Azure SQL databases come with automated point-in-time backups, so `BACPAC` files are primarily used for moving databases from one server to another - as we're doing here.

1. Open Azure Data Studio and connect to the "on-premise" database using the details provided by your tutor.
   * Use the "SQL Login" Authentication type
2. Right click on the database and choose "Data-tier Application Wizard".
   * If you can't see this option, check you installed the dacpac extension above
3. Follow the steps to create a `.bacpac` backup of the database, and name it "database.bacpac".
   * The operation is "Export the schema and data from a database to the logical .bacpac file format [Export Bacpac]"
   * This sometimes take a few minutes, you can carry on with step 2 below in the meantime

### Step 2: Upload the backup to Azure

Now we will upload the bacpac file to an Azure storage container ready to restore it later.

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/devops.corndel.com) and make sure you're in the "Corndel DevOps Academy" directory - it should appear in the top right below your name
2. In the Azure portal, search for "Storage Accounts" in the top level search bar (in the blue bar, right at the top of the page)
3. Click "Create" to create a new Storage Account, and configure it:
   * Select your workshop resource group (name ending in "_Workshop", not "_Workshop_M12_Pt2", that's for this afternoon)
   * Keep the default option for Performance (Standard) and select the "Locally-redundant" option for Redundancy.
   * Leave everything on the other tabs on their defaults
4. Once created, browse to the Account, and select "Containers" in the sidebar.
5. Create a new container called "bacpac".
6. Upload the file from Step 1 (with the name "database.bacpac") to the container.

Now, we have a `BACPAC` file in an Azure storage account - this is where it needs to be in order for us to restore the database.

### Step 3: Get the ARM template

We're ready to bring up our new database. The way we will do this is by provisioning resources in Azure using ARM templates. ARM (Azure Resource Manager) is the deployment and management system that allows you to create and modify resources in Azure, and ARM templates are JSON files which describe the resources you want.

ARM templates are therefore declarative - you define what resources you need, the configuration they need to have, and when you deploy, the tooling will take imperative action to create the resource (if it doesn't exist), update the resource (if it exists, but is not as defined in your template), or do nothing (if the resource exists and is exactly as you already wanted it)!

This means that ARM templates are idempotent - you can deploy the same template multiple times, and (providing you enter the same parameters) you won't create duplicate resources. This is a very useful property for an IaC tool.

So you know what they look like, here is an example of an ARM template:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "storagePrefix": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 3,
      "maxLength": 11
    },
    "storageSKU": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "Standard_LRS",
      "allowedValues": [
        "Standard_LRS",
        "Standard_GRS",
        "Standard_RAGRS",
        "Standard_ZRS",
        "Premium_LRS",
        "Premium_ZRS",
        "Standard_GZRS",
        "Standard_RAGZRS"
      ]
    },
    "location": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]"
    },
    "appServicePlanName": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "exampleplan"
    }
  },
  "variables": {
    "uniqueStorageName": "[concat(parameters('storagePrefix'), uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]"
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      "apiVersion": "2019-04-01",
      "name": "[variables('uniqueStorageName')]",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "sku": {
        "name": "[parameters('storageSKU')]"
      },
      "kind": "StorageV2",
      "properties": {
        "supportsHttpsTrafficOnly": true
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Web/serverfarms",
      "apiVersion": "2016-09-01",
      "name": "[parameters('appServicePlanName')]",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "sku": {
        "name": "B1",
        "tier": "Basic",
        "size": "B1",
        "family": "B",
        "capacity": 1
      },
      "kind": "linux",
      "properties": {
        "perSiteScaling": false,
        "reserved": true,
        "targetWorkerCount": 0,
        "targetWorkerSizeId": 0
      }
    }
  ],
  "outputs": {
    "storageEndpoint": {
      "type": "object",
      "value": "[reference(variables('uniqueStorageName')).primaryEndpoints]"
    }
  }
}
```

That was a relatively small one - they can get somewhat verbose. Don't worry, the structure is pretty simple - ARM templates have a high-level structure that looks like the following:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "",
  "parameters": {  },
  "variables": {  },
  "functions": [  ],
  "resources": [  ],
  "outputs": {  }
}
```

It's important to know what each of these are.

`$schema` defines what version of the templating language you are using. Depending on the type of editor you use, or the scale of deployment you're performing, this can change.

`contentVersion` is for your use - you can put the version of the template in here, e.g. `"1.0.0.0"`.

`parameters` is a JSON object that specifies what each of the inputs to your template are. You will naturally want to parameterise your template - you will likely wish to re-use it to create different environments, or have different configurations. You can do this using parameters, which can be referred to later in the template. Parameters can take a default value, otherwise they must be specified when deployed - either from a `parameters.json` file, or elsewhere (e.g. at the command line). There are other useful things you can do with parameters too, such as defining a fixed set of values they're allowed to take on!

`variables` is a slightly misleading name - this is actually an object where you can set constants that you might want to use across the rest of your template. If you need to calculate a value (e.g. the name of a resource) by evaluating an expression (taking the date, converting to string, etc) then this is where you would want to do it.

`functions` allows you to create user-defined functions for use in the template.

`resources` will be a large part of the template - this is where you specify the resources that you want deployed or updated. Resources have types, names, and other data.

`outputs` allows you to specify values that you want to be returned after deployment. Generally, you will want to do this to retrieve information about the resources you've just deployed (e.g. the URL of a web service).

You now know almost enough to write your own ARM template from scratch! However, this is normally not necessary, and is not what we'll be doing today. It is generally easier and less error-prone to work from and modify an existing template, and there are several ways in which you can get an existing template.

One way is to go to the Azure web portal, and go through the motions of manually creating the resource you want via the web interface. Then, at the final step before deployment, Azure will provide you with the option of downloading the ARM template that corresponds to the resource you've just said you wanted to make - convenient! It's all the ease of use and intuitiveness of manually provisioning resources with a wizard, but with all the benefits of version controlled IaC.

Let's do this now for each of the SQL Server and App Service resources you'll need to deploy.

#### SQL Server

1. In the Azure Portal, search for "SQL databases" in the top search bar and then click "create".
2. Configure the database settings
    1. Select your resource group
    2. Choose "Create new" for the server and choose "Use SQL Authentication" for the Authentication Method (set any value for the username and password you like - we are just here to generate a template).
    3. Hit "Configure database" and select the Basic tier.
3. Check that you completed the above. Click "Review and create" **but** don't hit create after.
4. Take a moment to check the details, you should see:
    * Under "Basics", the Server is described as "(new)" and is "Basic: 2GB storage"
5. **The magic happens!** Rather than actually creating the resource, click "Download a template for automation".
6. Click the download button and extract the zip.

Once you've extracted the zip, you'll notice that it contained two files! You should see a `template.json` file, and a `parameters.json` file.
We talked about parameters before - these are the inputs to your template that can change in order to make your template useful in other scenarios or environments.

When you're deploying an ARM template, you can specify all the required parameters by hand (on the command line, or elsewhere). However, that's a little unwieldy, and a better option is often to also specify a second JSON file (alongside the template to be deployed) that defines all the parameters you want to pass in. This is what this `parameters.json` file is. If you look at the parameters declared at the top of the `template.json`, and the parameters specified in the `parameters.json`, you'll see the proof - they match up!

### Step 4: Add backup to database

Sadly the Azure Portal won't allow direct use of the backup file we created, so we need to add it to the the ARM template ourselves.

We can follow the steps below which are derived from this guide: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-tutorial-deploy-sql-extensions-bacpac#edit-the-template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-tutorial-deploy-sql-extensions-bacpac#edit-the-template)

1. Add the following to `parameters` in `template.json`:

```json
  "importDatabase": {
    "type": "bool"
  },
 "storageAccountKey": {
    "type":"string",
    "metadata":{
      "description": "Specifies the key of the storage account where the BACPAC file is stored."
    }
  },
  "bacpacUrl": {
    "type":"string",
    "metadata":{
      "description": "Specifies the URL of the BACPAC file."
    }
  },
```

2. Add the following to the database in the template. Insert it just below the `"type": "databases"` line, but within the same resource - i.e. this should be a child resource of the database, which is itself a child resource of the SQL Server.

```json
"resources": [
  {
    "type": "extensions",
    "apiVersion": "2014-04-01",
    "name": "Import",
    "dependsOn": [
      "[resourceId('Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases', parameters('serverName'), parameters('databaseName'))]"
    ],
    "condition": "[parameters('importDatabase')]",
    "properties": {
      "storageKeyType": "StorageAccessKey",
      "storageKey": "[parameters('storageAccountKey')]",
      "storageUri": "[parameters('bacpacUrl')]",
      "administratorLogin": "[parameters('administratorLogin')]",
      "administratorLoginPassword": "[parameters('administratorLoginPassword')]",
      "operationMode": "Import"
    }
  }
]
```

3. Add the following to `parameters.json`

```json
"importDatabase": {
    "value": false
},
"storageAccountKey": {
    "value": ""
},
"bacpacUrl": {
    "value": "https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/bacpac/database.bacpac"
},
```

**Wait!** Did you notice? The directions got us to add a resource with the `condition` property. This allows us to specify a condition under which this resource will be provisioned as directed, or ignored entirely.  This is useful for a wide variety of reasons. So, before you move on - where is it added, how is it used, and why?

> Don't forget to update the bacpacUrl variable, and if you named your container or file differently (from bacpac/database.bacpac) you will need to ensure the URL matches your resource.

### Step 5: Allow external connections

Since this will be a test database we need to allow external users to connect.
Let's add a firewall rule that allows access from all IPs, i.e. from `0.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`.

> This could instead be, for example, your office's external IP address range, but we'll keep it simple and allow connections from everywhere

The template should already have a couple of resources of type "firewallrules". Copy one of those and adjust it to enable connections from all IPs.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "2014-04-01-preview",
    "dependsOn": [
        "[concat('Microsoft.Sql/servers/', parameters('serverName'))]"
    ],
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "name": "AllowAllIps",
    "properties": {
        "startIpAddress": "0.0.0.0",
        "endIpAddress": "255.255.255.255"
    },
    "type": "firewallrules"
},
```

</details>

For this firewall rule to be accepted, we'll also need to enable public network access; change the value of the `PublicNetworkAccess` parameter in `parameters.json` to "Enabled" to ensure this firewall rule can be applied.

### Step 6: Output connection details

Once we have created the database we need to know how to connect to it.
ARM Templates have outputs that you can see after running a deployment, they are documented here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/outputs>

Add outputs to your ARM template for the server domain name, administrator username and password.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

You'll need to add a new "outputs" property to the top level JSON object in template.json.

```json
"outputs": {
    "serverDomainName": {
        "type": "string",
        "value": "[reference(parameters('serverName')).fullyQualifiedDomainName]"
    },
    "adminLogin": {
        "type": "string",
        "value": "[parameters('administratorLogin')]"
    },
    "adminPassword": {
        "type": "string",
        "value": "[parameters('administratorLoginPassword')]"
    }
}
```

</details>

### Step 7: Deploy the template

Our template is finally ready to deploy! Here are the final steps we need to take.

1. Make up a password for the database. There are minimum complexity rules for this password, so make it long-ish (more than 7 characters), with numbers, symbols and both cases of letters.
2. Go to the storage account you created and copy the first key in the "Access Keys" section.
3. **It's time!** Run `az deployment group create --name m12deployment --resource-group <resource_group> --template-file template.json --parameters parameters.json --parameters administratorLoginPassword=<db_password> --parameters storageAccountKey=<storage_access_key> --parameters importDatabase=true -c`, replacing the `<placeholders>` as appropriate.
4. Confirm the deployment (this step is required by the `-c` parameter).
    * The deployment might take several minutes
5. Confirm this worked by connecting to your new database from Azure Data studio.
    * The connection string should appear in the output from the command above, if you can't find it try running `az deployment show --name m12deployment --resource-group <resource_group> | jq '.properties.outputs'`, or find it in the Azure portal, go to your resource group, then Deployments -> m12deployment -> Outputs
    * It might take a couple of minutes for the bacpac file to finish deploying, once it does you should see the DemoTable in your database

## Next steps

That's it! We've now got a template anyone can use to spin up and restore a fresh copy of the database in Azure.

There are more stretch goals below if you would like to keep practising with ARM templates, but we suggest you move on to the next exercise instead and have a go with Terraform, and come back here later if you would like.

[**Part 2 - Migrate to IaC**](../MigrateToIaC/instructions.md)

## Stretch goal

Now we have the database working we can adjust our template to create the web app too, and set them up to connect to each other.

### (Stretch) Step 1: App service template

1. Search for "App Services" in the top search bar and then click "create".
2. Choose Docker Container on Linux.
3. Create a new App Service Plan (change size to the Dev B1 Tier).
4. On the Docker tab choose Image Source "Docker Hub" and Image and Tag "corndeldevopscourse/mod12app:latest".
5. Click "Review and create".
6. Take a moment to check the details, you should see:
    * Under "Details", a reference to the Docker container
    * The "App Service Plan" section should be marked "(New)", and be SKU "Basic"
7. **The magic happens (again)!** Rather than actually creating the resource, click "Download a template for automation".
8. Click the download button and extract the zip.

### (Stretch) Step 2: Combine your templates

We now have ARM templates that will provision the resources we need! However, the information is currently contained within two separate templates, and for such a simple architecture it would be better to have just one template. Fortunately, we are now armed with enough knowledge of the templates' anatomy to perform this merging operation ourselves.

Merge these into single `template.json` and `parameters.json` files:

1. Start with the SQL database files from the original exercise.
2. Copy and paste the parameters,  resources, and variables from the App Service `template.json` file into their respective arrays in the final `template.json` file.
3. Copy and paste the parameters from the App Service `parameters.json` file into the parameters field in the final `parameters.json` file.
4. Make sure you haven't introduced any anomalies.

Hints:

* You will need to remove the duplicate `location` parameter in both files.
* You will want to ensure the latest of the two `$schema` values is used at the top of each file.

### (Stretch) Step 3: Add configuration

We're almost there, but a couple of changes are needed in order for the App Service to be able to talk to the Database.

This is what needs changing. Can you figure out what changes to make, and where?

* We need to set the parameter `allowAzureIps` to `true`.
* We need to set the parameter `dockerRegistryPassword` to `""`.
* We need to add a new variable called `connectionString`, with the value `"[concat('Server=tcp:', parameters('serverName'), '.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=', parameters('databaseName'), ';Persist Security Info=False;User ID=', parameters('administratorLogin'), ';Password=', parameters('administratorLoginPassword'), ';MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;')]"`
* We need to add two new values in the `appSettings` for the `siteConfig` for the web site.
  * The name of the first will be `"CONNECTION_STRING"` and its value will need to come from the variable `connectionString` that we defined earlier.
  * The name of the second will be `"DEPLOYMENT_METHOD"` and its value will be `"ARM Template"`

Hints:

* You can specify that the value for an item should come from a parameter by using this syntax as the value: `"[variables('connectionString')]"`

<details><summary>Answer (spoilers!)</summary>

1. In `parameters.json`, set `allowAzureIps` to `true` and the value of `dockerRegistryPassword` to `""`.
2. Add the following to the `variables` object in `template.json`:

```json
"connectionString":
"[concat('Server=tcp:', parameters('serverName'), '.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=', parameters('databaseName'), ';Persist Security Info=False;User ID=', parameters('administratorLogin'), ';Password=', parameters('administratorLoginPassword'), ';MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;')]"
```

3. Then add the following to `appSettings` array in `template.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "CONNECTION_STRING",
  "value": "[variables('connectionString')]"
},
{
  "name": "DEPLOYMENT_METHOD",
  "value": "ARM Template"
},
```

</details>

### (Stretch) Step 4: Deploy the template

Our new template is ready to deploy!

Deploy the template using th same command as last time, then confirm this worked by browsing to `https://<webapp_name>.azurewebsites.net/`, or find the created App Service in Azure Portal and click on its URL.

You should see the following JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "Successfully connected to the db containing info for Module 12 Workshop",
  "deploymentMethod": "ARM Template"
}
```

Hopefully, you now have a provisioned website! Or close to one - importing a `BACPAC` file can take a few minutes. If your site hasn't fully provisioned yet, feel free to make a start on the next step. Make sure you commit your code before continuing!

### (Stretch) Step 5: Tidy up

Hopefully, you've now seen that your template works. It was a lot less effort to start from an existing template or two than to write it all from scratch! But, there are some clear disadvantages, too.

The `template.json` and `parameters.json` have quite a lot of redundant code that we aren't planning on using.
In fact, some of it won't work without changes to the template.
The App Service won't be able to communicate by a private network just by configuring the database to.

We should tidy this up so it is possible to see what we intended.
If you search for the word "private" in `template.json`, you'll see it's only mentioned in some resources that are conditional on parameters like `enablePrivateEndpoint` which are all false in `parameters.json`. So: let's delete all those parameters, resources, and variables.

1. Delete any parameters, resources and variables with `private` in them, in both files.
2. Redeploy by running `az deployment group create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --template-file template.json --parameters parameters.json --parameters administratorLoginPassword=<password> -c` (the earlier command, but without the parameters required for importing a database).
3. You'll see that redeploying will make some changes to the existing resources (since the ARM Template doesn't exactly line up with the created resource) rather than try to recreate them. We can see them because the `-c` flag uses functionality called `what-if` ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-deploy-what-if?tabs=azure-powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-deploy-what-if?tabs=azure-powershell)).

You can use `what-if` in order to simulate the effect of deploying a template, without actually deploying it.

### (Stretch) Step 6: Check out the site

Head back to `https://<webapp_name>.azurewebsites.net/`.

As before you should see the following JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "Successfully connected to the db containing info for Module 12 Workshop",
  "deploymentMethod": "ARM Template"
}
```
